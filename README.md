## Bikeshare Project
This script was created for the **Programming for Data Science with Python** nanodegree by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

This is my first Python program and it utilises the numpy, pandas, time and datetime libraries.

## Description
The `bikeshare_2.py` file is a Python script that provides descriptive statistical insights into bikeshare data from Washington, Chicago and New York City.

The experience is interactive... depending on a user's input the resulting stats will change! 

There are four questions that will determine the results:

    1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
    2. Would you like to filter the data by January, February, March, April, May, June or all?
    3. Would you like to filter the data by Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday or all?
    4. Would you like to view the raw data?


After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.

If the user chooses to view raw data the script should print 5 rows of the data at a time.

## Date created
The **Bikeshare Project** script was written on **14 January 2024**.
