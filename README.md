### Date created
The **Bikeshare Project** script was written on **14 January 2024**.

### Bikeshare Project
This script was created for the **Programming for Data Science with Python** nanodegree by Udacity.
The datasets come from [Motivate](https://motivateco.com/).
Data from Washington, Chicago and New York City can be analysed using the program.

### Description
The `bikeshare_2.py` file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. 
The experience is interactive, depending on a user's input the resulting stats will change! 

There are four questions that will change the answers:
1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
3. (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
4. (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which you'll do data analysis. 
After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.

The script also prompts the user whether they would like want to see the raw data. 
If the user answers 'yes,' then the script should print 5 rows of the data at a time, then ask the user if they would like to see 5 more rows of the data.
